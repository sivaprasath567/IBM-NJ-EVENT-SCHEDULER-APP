options to click on an event for detailed information or modify schedules
directly from the interface.
The Reminder and Notification Module adds a layer of automation and
convenience to the application. Once users register for an event, the system
automatically schedules reminders that are delivered via email or push
notifications before the event date. These reminders ensure better attendance
and engagement by keeping participants informed about upcoming activities.
The demo illustrates how the system handles different notification triggers,
such as upcoming event reminders, registration confirmations, and event
updates. This feature enhances the reliability of the application and
demonstrates its ability to operate autonomously with minimal
administrative intervention.
To evaluate the system’s analytical capabilities, the Reports and Analytics
Module is presented in the final part of the demonstration. Admins can
generate and view comprehensive reports summarizing total events,
participant numbers, and scheduling trends over time. Graphical
representations such as bar charts and pie charts provide a clear visual
understanding of data patterns, helping in decision-making and future event
planning. This feature not only validates the system’s ability to handle large
datasets efficiently but also showcases the integration of data visualization
tools for improved management insights.
Finally, the Deployed System Demo confirms that the Event Scheduler
Application is fully operational in a live environment. The backend of the
system is hosted on IBM Cloud, ensuring scalability and robust server-side
processing, while the frontend is deployed on Netlify or Vercel for optimal
performance and accessibility. The demonstration is conducted through a
browser, highlighting the application’s responsiveness, interactivity, and
real-time data synchronization between client and server. This live
walkthrough validates that all components—authentication, event
scheduling, reminders, and reporting—function cohesively, meeting the
intended user requirements. The successful deployment signifies that the
application is production-ready and capable of supporting real-world event
management scenarios efficiently.

Abstract
The Event Scheduler App is a cloud-based web platform that allows
administrators and users to efficiently create, manage, and track events and
meetings. It eliminates manual scheduling issues by automating notifications
and reminders, ensuring users never miss important activities. The
application provides real-time event management with an interactive
calendar view, detailed reports, and user-friendly navigation. With
responsive design and robust backend integration, it is suitable for both
organizations and individuals who require reliable event planning and time
management.
Introduction
Event scheduling is a vital task in academic, corporate, and personal
environments, but traditional manual methods often result in overlapping
schedules, missed deadlines, and poor communication. This project aims to
address these problems by providing an automated Event Scheduler System
that leverages modern web technologies and cloud computing. The platform
ensures that users can schedule, update, and monitor their events from
anywhere with internet access. Moreover, the system integrates automatic
reminders through email, providing an end-to-end digital solution for time
management.
The project follows the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) with
emphasis on modular development, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
Each phase—from requirements gathering to testing—has been carefully
executed to ensure smooth functionality and a user-centric design.
Problem Statement
Organizations frequently face issues when managing multiple events
simultaneously. Miscommunication between departments, unrecorded
updates, and forgotten reminders often lead to poor time utilization. Manual
methods, such as using spreadsheets or paper-based scheduling, are
inefficient in today’s digital age. Hence, this project proposes an automated,
centralized event scheduler that manages all event-related data in a single
platform, supporting real-time updates, automatic notifications, and easy
accessibility. This digital approach reduces manual workload and minimizes
the risk of human error.
Objectives of the Project
The primary objective of the Event Scheduler Application is to provide a
simple yet powerful tool for event management. The goals include:
1. Developing a web-based application that allows users to create and
manage events easily.
2. Implementing an authentication system to ensure secure access for
administrators and users.
3. Providing a calendar-based interface to visualize and organize events.
4. Enabling automatic reminder emails to improve attendance.
5. Generating analytical reports on event statistics using visual charts.
6. Hosting the system on cloud platforms for scalability and
accessibility.
System Requirements
Hardware Requirements
Processor: Intel Core i3 or higher
RAM: Minimum 4GB
Storage: 500MB minimum for project files
Internet Connection: Required for cloud deployment

Technology Stack
1. Frontend:
The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an
interactive, responsive design that works smoothly across all screen sizes.
2. Backend:
The backend uses Node.js and Express.js to handle API routes,
authentication, and communication between the client and the database.
3. Database:
MongoDB is used as the NoSQL database for storing user credentials, event
details, and reminder schedules.
4. Authentication:
JWT (JSON Web Token) ensures secure login and session management for
users and administrators.
5. Notifications:
Nodemailer library is integrated for sending automatic reminder emails.
6. Reports & Visualization:
Chart.js is implemented for generating graphical analytics in the admin
dashboard.
7. Hosting & Version Control:
Frontend is deployed on Netlify/Vercel, and backend is hosted on IBM
Cloud, with GitHub used for source code management and collaboration.
System Architecture
The application follows a three-tier architecture:
1. Presentation Layer (Frontend): Handles user interaction, displaying
event data and collecting user input.
2. Application Layer (Backend): Processes business logic,
authentication, and routing requests.
3. Database Layer: Manages persistent data storage using MongoDB.
Data flows between layers through RESTful API endpoints, ensuring
modularity and reusability.
